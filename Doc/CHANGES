From 4.0 to 4.1 (using fxgrep version 4.1)
====================
(05.06.2003)
Uses as pattern the fxgrep patterns allowing matches to be specifies
via formulas

From 3.0 to 4.0 (using fxgrep version 4.0)
====================
(18.02.2003)
Changes in the interface to fxgrep to allow for fxgrep patterns with
conjunctions and negations of paths.
Updated automatic translation to binary match patterns.
Updated documentation.
(15.10.2002)
Automatic translation of select patterns to binary match patterns.

From 2.1.2 to 3.0
====================
(03.09.2002)
updated documentation
nodes can be selected using binary fxgrep patterns
(07.05.2002)
added --literal option
removed fxt:literate
removed literateText from FDM signature

From 2.1.1 to 2.1.2
====================
(08.04.2002)
Small modification in the interface to fxgrep2
(08.03.2002)
Removed a bug occuring when using global variables
Updated documentation

From 2.1 to 2.1.1
====================
(01.03.2002)
Modified makefiles to improve the convenience of using generated code
from within other SML code

(14.01.2002)
Removed possibility of name conflicts between globals and internal
variables

From 2.0 to 2.1
====================
(17.09.2001)
Added profiling code

(21.09.2001)
Modified the generated code for sorting forests (to compensate for the
SML function ListMergeSort.sort which does not preserve the order of
elements with equal keys)

(27.09.2001)
Improved extra matching for filling in tables

(1.10.2001)
Added selectExp attribute in fxt:apply to allow info from the input to
be used in dynamic pattern matching

(23.10.2001)
Corrected error in the output of types (added parentheses)

(17.11.2001)
Added fxt:inc element

From 1.3 to 2.0
====================
(27.08.2001)

Internal changes:	
Drastically reduced the compilation time.
Minimized the size of the SML generated code.

Improved compile error messages.
Added options and help for the transformation.

New options for fxt:
  -i xmlInputFile
  -o xmlOutputFile
If an xmlInputFile is specified and possibly an XML output file, 
at the compile time than the generated transformation is consequently
called with the XML input and output as arguments. Useful when the
transformation is used only once.

From 1.2 to 1.3 
====================
(10.07.2001)

fxt:addAttribute, fxt:deleteAttribute, fxt:replaceAttribute,
fxt:copyTagAddAttribute, fxt:copyTagDeleteAttribute,
fxt:copyTagReplaceAttribute, fxt:attribute: 
  The former name and val attributes have changed names to nameExp and
  valExp respectively. Instead, one can now directly specify the name
  or the value of the involved attribute as values for a name or a val
  attribute respectively.

fxt:pi
  The former processor and data attributes have changed names to
  processorExp and dataExp respectively. Instead, one can now directly
  specify the processor and the data value of the processing
  instruction to be generated as values for a processor or a data
  attribute respectively.

(5.07.2001)

Added support for keys


From 1.1 to 1.2 
====================
(17.04.2001)

Select patterns (dynamic pattern matching) are allowed in fxt:apply
  and fxt:copyContent

Fixed a bug in the script generation 

From 1.0 to 1.1
====================
(15.03.2001)

Fixed a bug (a name-conflict): 
  a test attribute in fxt:apply was intepreted  both
  as a predicate specifying the sons on which the transformation
  must proceed and a filter for the output forest. Filtering is now
  indicated by an attribute named filter.

Added shortcuts for often used elements:
  fxt:currentText, fxt:ht, fxt:cr, fxt:sp, fxt:attribute
